### Why I use Neovim 
Using Neovim has really sped up my developer process in trying to get the most portable, efficient, and customizable developmnent environment.
I think most people should really give neovim a try and thats why I have this repository up. It is cloned from the Primagean but I plan on configuring it so it is more to my own liking.

The plan is to merge this with a more portable workflow so i can develop on my own local server from anywhere in the world and code with less setups.
